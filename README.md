# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the risk of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques in Python.
The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow of a prediction model, including:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, correlations, and key health indicators.

Model Training: Applying machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.

Evaluation: Measuring the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy and other metrics.

The aim of this project is to showcase how health-related datasets can be analyzed and used to predict heart disease, aiding in preventive healthcare.
